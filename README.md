# Syndromic surveillance

## Reproduction of results
To reproduce the results and to get the data essential for the dashboard, run the notebooks in the following order:
1. import-cleaning.ipynb
2. clustering-for-cdss-evaluation
3. evaluate-clustering
4. clustering-for-syndromic-surveillance
5. explorative-analysis

## Research topic
Comparing clustering based on MODN's representation of patients to traditionally clustering based on features (demographic and symptoms). Does it help against the inevitable structural missingness of CDSS?
