currently
- cluster features with nan values (two ways: kmoidos --> issue: scikit_learn_extra cannot be installed, kprototypes --> issue: requires declaration of categorical features)
- do base line spatio-temporal clustering:
    - cluster three datasets different regarding how missingness is addressed
        1. symptom and demographic data with NAN values --> use kmeans variation that handles NAN (kmeans++ or fuzzy clustering or GMM)
        3. impute NAN as above. however, we also always add a binary column keeping track if value of respective feature is imputed or not --> analyse if imputation is picked up by clusters
    - compute centroids of shape in data prep notebook
        - find out format of given coordinates in shape file. they seem to be utm
        - make code final data prep notebook --> make a fnial data set stored as pickleee
        - make it possible so that and analysis notbook easily gets spatial dimension
    - make rough analysis of spatial and temporal dimension using hf coordinates and px.density_mapbox with date slider
- research reviews: systematic missingness clustering and clustering of representation (medarchive, padme, google scholar)

ask sascha: what amount of clusters would not make sense, this is the biggest k for the elbow method
how to visualise villages on map best (use shape coordinates or do i need to engineer a coordinate pair) --> try visualising the shapes
    - use interactive heat map for spatial-temporal analysis using "health_facility_longitude", "health_facility_latitude" as location(alternatively: use centre of shape of each village)
        fig = px.density_mapbox(results3, lat='LAT', lon='LON', z='CO2',hover_name = 'LocationName',
                                hover_data = ['altitude', 'SensorUnit_ID','zone'], radius=10,
                                center=dict(lat=47.38, lon=8.5), zoom=9, animation_frame='Date',
                                mapbox_style="stamen-terrain")
        fig.show()
ask sasha:
- which columns are symptoms and which are diagnosis? (get understanding of the used abbreviations)
- which symptoms should i focus on aka which should i use for clustering or should i use all (assume: a is proxy of diagnosis)
- which columns can i get rid of? (to keep: data for hf, patient, symptoms, diagnosis ... else?)
cluster using 
- k-means (as standard)
- Gaussian Mixture models
- co-clustering (suggested by former semester project by Paloma) as it includes spatio-temporal features in the algo
- Agglomerative clustering (according to Paloma too much computational cost)
