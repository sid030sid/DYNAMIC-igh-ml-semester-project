currently:
- how to visualise villages on map best (use shape coordinates or do i need to engineer a coordinate pair) --> try visualising the shapes
- once data cleaning and prepariton is confirmed to be correct and valid. clean the notebook: rw-explorative-analysis
- make a list of columns you have selected for the clustering of demographic and symptoms, and validate wth annie and domain expert
- run k-means ++ or k-means for spatio-temporal, fuzzy clustering and GMM algo (deal with NaN values)

add village column (based on cleaning current village column)
ask annie:
- report on missingness of symptoms columns --> due to nature of CDSS (= a decision tree) the data holds a lot of null values, thus instead of considering this during data cleaning (with e.g. data imputing) I would rather use clustering algo which can handle NaN values e.g. extensions of K-Means instead of trad K-mean 
- what do i need to do for semester project registration on is academia
symptoms missingness not yet determined
ask sasha:
- some villages have a fifth description (besides village, cell, sector, district) -what to do with this?
- how to get longitude and latitude for the villages in the master list
- which columns are symptoms and which are diagnosis? (get understanding of the used abbreviations)
- which symptoms should i focus on aka which should i use for clustering or should i use all (assume: a is proxy of diagnosis)
- which columns can i get rid of? (to keep: data for hf, patient, symptoms, diagnosis ... else?)



Get rid of unnecessary columns: 
- focus on symptoms (as experts want)
- quality control of features: missingness and low variance needs to be determined --> helps for selection
Descriptive analysis of data of important aspect (itself, per hf, per day, per hf and day):
- space: hf and village 
cluster in 
- k-means (as standard)
- Gaussian Mixture models
- co-clustering (suggested by former semester project by Paloma) as it includes spatio-temporal features in the algo
- Agglomerative clustering (according to Paloma too much computational cost)
analysis time and space of each cluster (make sure not to just cluster the diagnosis)
basic inform yourself about geo spatial clustering + re read projects of other students
